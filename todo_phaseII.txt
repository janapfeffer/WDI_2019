(parallel) recreate and fuse gold standard for transfers
done: find matches and so on
todo: fuse golden standards

1 identity resolution: different approaches for similarity measures (name, dob, height)
implemented: height, name FIFA-ESD, API-transfer and FIFA-API, dob FIFA-ESD and FIFA-API
todo: more dob and height comparators

2 blocking: different approaches
implemented: based on first letter, one year, 5 years, height 
todo: try different ones (even though they are worse) for report 

3 quality evaluation using different methods (KPIs) 
implemented: Precision, Recall, F1
todo: record results in report

4 [todo] experiment with different similarity measures and record the results (-> report)

5 [todo] implement machine learning
-> split gs into training and test data (stratified split 80-20)

6 [todo] include transfers and developments in formatters and readers (for fusion)
